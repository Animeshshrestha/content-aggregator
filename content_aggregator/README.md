# News Content Aggregator
This project aims to scraps the news from three different website and saves the news to the database. The user can get the news per according to his/her selection.

# Note
There are two branch named API based and template based.
- On  <b> API based branch </b> I have used django rest framework for making REST API along with VUE JS as Frontend. On Vue JS I have not completed the part of pagination and form where user can select the news category of his/her choice.

P.S. : Link to VUE JS repository:

- On <b> Template based branch </b> I have used django as default backend and used HTML, Jquery, CSS for frontend.
